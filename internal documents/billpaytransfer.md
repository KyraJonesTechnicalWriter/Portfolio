## Overview
This document will explain how to move existing payees over to a new Bill Pay "subscriber" after an account transfer. Before you can transfer the payee’s and information to a new subscriber, the member will first need to enroll in Bill Pay on their new Home Banking profile.

## Instructions
1. Search for the member by last name. This should pull up at least two different subscribers for the member, but the user ID and account numbers will be different. View these until you find the one with the new account number.

2. Copy the user ID and put it aside. Now, add "XX" to the end of the user ID and save out of the Bill Pay subscriber. 

3. Now, pull up the member’s previous subscriber account and take the user ID you saved from step 2 and place it as the user ID on this new subscriber. You will also need to change the old account number to the updated account number. Hit *Save*.

4. Go back to the subscriber from step 2 that should now have "XX" at the end. Scroll to the bottom and hit *Deactivate Subscriber*. Click *Continue* through all the questions that pop-up.

5. Finally, a survey page should open. Choose *No* for all the questions and in the *Comment section*, note that the member has another login.

6. The payees are now moved over. Let the member know that they will need to make payments by visiting the Bill Pay Site in Home Banking. After about 2-3 days, the Bill Pay site should integrate into Home Banking and the member can make the payments as normal.
